Introduction

Auxiliary material for this article contains Fortran code for converting from geodetic to Quasi-Dipole (QD) and
Modified Apex coordinates, for computing base vectors in these coordinates, for converting
from QD to geodetic coordinates, and for generating expansion coefficients for these conversions,
as described in the paper. Updated versions of this code will be made available on the 
CEDAR Data System at http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/.

checkapexsh.f90: Fortran-90 test driver and usage example for the QD 
coordinate conversion code package.

2. 2010ja015326-txts02.txt 
apexsh.f90: Fortran-90 code for converting among coordinate systems
and computing base vectors. This file contains all the routines necessary to do the conversions.
The last three files are only needed to generate a file containing  the expansion coefficients.

coefficients used by apexsh.f90. Must be compiled together with apexsh.f90, apex.f, and magfld.f.
