mfield_ascii - convert binary coefficient file to ASCII format

STEPS FOR MAKING A MAIN FIELD MODEL
===================================

1. Run mfield_preproc on all satellite data files needed for model
   a. Typically use MFIELD_FIT_Z_HIGHLAT = 0 to use F at high-latitudes (historically)

PLOTTING
========

1. To plot temporal distribution of vector and scalar data:
   a. Run mfield on all 3 Swarm datasets to generate datamap.dat.{0,1,2}
   b. Run plothist.sh to make data histograms
   c. Run plothist.gp to make 'hist.png' plot

2. To plot time vs latitude distribution of data:
   a. Run plot_spatial.gp to make 'spatial.png' plot
